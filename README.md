# RoboNinjaWarriorRaspberryPi

This repository contains the necessary code for configuring a raspberry pi image for the Neato

To install:

Flash a new SD card using the [Raspbian 2015-05-07 Wheezy image](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2015-05-07/2015-05-05-raspbian-wheezy.zip) (We are stuck on an old version of Raspbian due to dependencies on older hardware that doesn't work readily with newer versions.  If you get this working with a newer version of Raspbian, we'd like to hear about it).

On the Pi as root run (make sure you are in the RoboNinjaWarriorRaspberryPi directory):

./setup.sh
